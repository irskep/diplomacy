creating a python file that interfaces with a webpage AND the diplomacy database
	see example db_example.py and corresponding file db_example.html

creating a stored proceture (save as .sql or .txt in stored procedures folder)
	need these lines:
		DELIMITER $$
		USE diplomacy
		DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS name_of_procedure $$
		CREATE PROCEDURE name_of_procedure()
			# if you want to be able to pass in variables, may do name_of_procedure(IN variable_name VARIABLETYPE(), IN variable_name2 VARIABLETYPE()... )
		BEGIN

		(put new commands here)

		END
		$$
		Delimiter ;

	once a file is created, put it into the diplomacy database using command line sql:
		SOURCE /srv/diplomacy/stored_procedures/name_of_file.sql;
		note- the first time you put it in, there will be a WARNING given. This is ok. 

Use a stored procedure directly from command line sql:
	CALL name_of_procedure();
		# if you have variables to pass in, use name_of_procedure(variable, variable2)
